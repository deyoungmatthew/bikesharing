# Summary

The typical user of the bike sharing service is a male subscriber that uses the bike for getting to and from work during the weekday and traveling around on the weekend. Considering that the certain bikes are used most often, we can see they are typically used for the same start and end locations an often.  It may be a good idea to either maintain those bikes more often, or offer various subscription models.  A weekday rider, weekend rider, and full time champion that encompasses both.  The full time rider could be at the same price as the current subscription while the other two could be slightly less for those just looking for either weekday or weekend rides, hopefully capturing more revenue int he process.

**Most of the rides started and ended in the same place meaning that bikes were being used for roundtrip services more often than one way:
